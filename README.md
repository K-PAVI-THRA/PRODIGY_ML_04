# PRODIGY_ML_04

I have developed a hand gesture recognition model aimed at accurately identifying and classifying various hand gestures based on Task-04: "Develop a hand gesture recognition model that can accurately identify and classify different hand gestures from image or video data, enabling intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems." The goal was to create a system that facilitates intuitive human-computer interaction through gesture-based controls.

### Dataset:
The dataset used is the *LeapGestRecog* dataset from Kaggle, which contains images of different hand gestures. These images were used to train and evaluate the model. You can access the dataset here: [LeapGestRecog](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gti-upm/leapgestrecog?select=leapGestRecog). It is a 2GB directory that should be downloaded and used for the code.

### Steps to Use the Dataset:
1. Download the dataset from the provided Kaggle link.
2. Upload the dataset to your Google Drive in a folder called "Datasets" to simplify the process.
3. Open Google Colab.
4. Add a code cell above your existing code in the provided .ipynb file to mount your Google Drive.
5. Run the code cells in the notebook after mounting the drive to access and use the dataset.

### Knowledge Gained:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: I mastered the process of loading and preprocessing image data, including resizing images and converting them to grayscale for consistency and to optimize input for the model.
   
2. **Data Handling**: I learned how to preprocess image data effectively, including converting images to grayscale, resizing for uniformity, and encoding labels for machine learning tasks.
   
3. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: I designed and implemented a CNN architecture to classify hand gestures accurately. This included configuring convolutional and pooling layers for feature extraction.
   
4. **Model Training**: I gained hands-on experience in training deep learning models, adjusting hyperparameters, and monitoring performance to ensure effective learning.
   
5. **Evaluation and Optimization**: I acquired insights into evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy and loss, and I learned the importance of model validation for reliable results.
   
6. **Saving Models**: I learned how to save and load trained models, allowing for reuse in future tasks or deployment.
